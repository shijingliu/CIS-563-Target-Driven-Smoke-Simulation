CIS-563-Target-Driven-Smoke-Simulation
======================================
I cooperated with Yanjie feng to implement this project.   
This project implemented smoke formation and transformation that can be applied to complicated target such as human face. 
More specifically, we added driven force and momentum term to the common Navier Stoke Equation. We modified density according to highfields algorithm. In addition to this, we utilize image segmentation algorithm to refine smoke transformation between two complicated geometry.
